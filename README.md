# Domestic Violence Analysis
This repository contains an R programming project for analyzing domestic violence using statistical and machine learning techniques. The project aims to understand the correlation between various socio-demographic factors and the incidence of domestic violence.
I employed machine learning techniques such as Classification Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Methods to analyze the data.
These techniques are particularly well-suited for identifying patterns and relationships within complex datasets, which can be valuable for understanding the factors that contribute to domestic violence.


## Objectives
* Analyze the Correlation Between Education Level and Domestic Violence: `Investigating how different education levels affect the occurrence of domestic violence.`
* Study the Impact of Marital Status on Domestic Violence: `Examining how various marital statuses influence domestic violence.`
* Explore the Age Distribution of Domestic Violence Victims: `Identifying patterns in the age demographics of domestic violence victims.`
* Identify Socio-Economic Factors Contributing to Domestic Violence: `Pinpointing socio-economic factors that may contribute to domestic violence incidents.`

## Features
* `Data Preprocessing and Cleaning`: Ensuring the data is accurate and ready for analysis.
* `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.
* `Statistical Modeling`: Applying statistical models to analyze the relationship between socio-demographic factors and domestic violence.
* `Model Evaluation`: Assessing the performance of the models used.
* `Visualization of Results`: Graphically representing the findings for better understanding.

## Files
* `domestic violence analysis.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the full analysis and code.
* `domestic-violence-analysis.pdf`: The PDF version of the R Markdown file, providing a detailed report of the analysis and results.
* `domestic.violence.csv`: The CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis and model training.
